Porque de estudar os kmers

1. What is the probability of seeing a given k-mer with certain nucleotide 
probabilities (this is more like a hidden markov model).

2. What is the frequency of seeing a given k-mer in a bag of k-mers, and is 
that frequency higher or lower than it should be by a null hypothesis? 
##### meu interesse.
Think of it as a bag of words problem where you have a bag of k-mers 
(total # of 7-mers examined in your chromosome) and a draw of a 
single k-mer is considered a success if it matches the one you want. 
We can compute the null hypothesis (probability of seeing a 7-mer with 
equally likely nucleotide choices) as (1 / 4)^k, so in your case, this is: 

P_null = 0.25^7 = 0.000061035

Now, going back to your bag of k-mers, you have observed each of these 7-mers 
a given number of times. To compute probability based on observations, a 
total number of words, and the probability of the null, we use the exact 
binomial test:

for( kmer in all_posible_kmers ) {
    kmer_results <- binom.test(x = num_observations[kmer],
                               n = total_num_kmers,
                               p = 0.000061035,
                               alternative = 'two.sided')
    kmer_pvalue <- kmer_results$p.value
}

x is the number of observations in your data for that given kmer, n is the 
total number of words (number of trials), and p is the null p. 
You'll have to construct the loop to iterate over all visited kmer counts
of interest. You want to consider a two-sided test, since you're interested 
in higher or lower than the null.
